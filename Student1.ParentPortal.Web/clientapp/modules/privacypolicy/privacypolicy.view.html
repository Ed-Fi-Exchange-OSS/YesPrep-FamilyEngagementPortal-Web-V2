                            Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

                        </p>

                        <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
                        <p>
                            This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this Family Portal. On some pages, you can update information and/or sign up to receive periodic communication or alerts. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

                                <li>Address</li>
                                <li>Email address</li>

                        <h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
                        <p>
                            We use the information you provide about yourself on our application to communicate with you in the way you indicate. We never publish or share your personal information with outside parties. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our applications. For example, we may tell our developers that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our application, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

To further protect your personal information, we do not store any sensitive information like social security numbers.

                            Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important. All student personal data remains the property of and is solely owned, and thereby controlled, by the schools implementing the Family Portal. We never publish or share their personal information with outside parties. We implement the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and we insure all assets follow the latest best practices in their use and management of information about students.
