This parent portal was made possible thanks to Yes Prep Public Schools and Student1.

The Parent Engagement Portal provides an easy-to-use view of student information, attendance, discipline, grades, and assessment scores with links to parent views in other applications. The Portal enables communication between members of the student’s “success team” by supporting text communications with automatic language translation.

	* In file Web.config -> AppSettings keys:
		* authentication.azure.tenant value = "[Enter your tenant name here e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com]"
		* authentication.azure.audience value = "[Enter your clientId here e.g. e9a5a8b6-8af7-4719-9821-0deef255f68e]" 
* Database Connection string located in the Web.config file.
* For alerts and emails update:
   * feedback.emails to contain the email that should receive the messages.
   * messaging.email.defaultFromEmail set to the email that will appear in the from field.
   * messaging.email.server set to your email provider server
   * messaging.email.user set to the user to send emails
   * messaging.email.pass set to the password to be able to send emails
